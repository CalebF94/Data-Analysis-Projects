# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains examples projects that I have completed. Each project contains the code used to complete the project as well as other supporting files such as datasets or variables definitions. Brief descriptions of each project are provided below.


## COVID-19 Project

This was class project I completed in my survival analysis course. In the project, I compare the effect that COVID-19 had three countries in the early stage of the pandemic. I perform an exploratory data analysis, and then perform some statistical analyses using techniques such as Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. The analysis is performed using R, Rmarkdown, and Latex. R packages used include ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, muhaz, survival, and survminer.

## MLB Salaries Project

This was independent project I completed in my free time. In the project, I scraped data from the internet and created a Shiny web app that can be used to compare salaries of MLB teams and players between the years of 1985 and 2016. The interactive app has numerous graphics and is user friendly. This project was completed in R and used packages such as Shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, and htmlab. The app can be accessed at the following link: [https://caleb94.shinyapps.io/MLBSalaries/](https://caleb94.shinyapps.io/MLBSalaries/)

## New York Flu Dashboard

This is an independent project I completed to demonstrate some of my Excel skills. The project is an Excel dashboard that analyzes and visualizes influenza infections in the state of New York. The dashboard demonstrates my knowledge of Excel functions, graphs, pivot tables, and data models. The Excel dashboard can be downloaded here: [https://github.com/CalebF94/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/New%20York%20Flu%20Dashboard/Flu%20Dashboard.xlsx](https://github.com/CalebF94/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/New%20York%20Flu%20Dashboard/Flu%20Dashboard.xlsx)


## PGA Tour Driving Distance Project

This is an independent project I completed using R and R markdown. In the project I determine whether driving distance on the PGA Tour has increased since 2007, and I attempt to find the underlying reason for the change. I created a web scraper in R to gather data from the PGA tour's official website, merged the data sets using a mySQL script, and generated a written report with multiple graphics. The project was completed using software and packages such as mySQL, R, Rmarkdown, ggplot, dplyr, reshape2, and rvest.

## PGA Tour Project

This was an independent project where I attempted to predict the stroke average and winners on the PGA Tour for the 2019 season. I used regression and classification methods such as KNN, SVM, random forest, and logistic regression. This project was completed in Rmarkdown in Rstudio and used packages such as caret, tree, random forest and the tidyverse packages.

## Skin Cancer EDA

This was a class assignment I completed using SAS. In the assignment I selected 10 variables from the well known SEER dataset and summarized them in a written report using tables, figures, and graphs. This project was completed using base SAS PROCS, DATA steps, and PROC SQL. The final written report can be found at the following link: [https://github.com/CalebF94/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Skin%20Cancer%20EDA/Skin%20Cancer%20EDA.pdf](https://github.com/CalebF94/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Skin%20Cancer%20EDA/Skin%20Cancer%20EDA.pdf)

## Wheel Of Fortune Project

This is an independent project where I analyzed data from the Bonus Round of the TV game show Wheel Of Fortune. I created a web scraper to gather data that allowed me to determine which letters appear most often, which letters contestants choose most often, and which categories are the hardest. This project was completed using R and Rmarkdown in Rstudio and used packages such as rvest, dplyr, lubridate, and kable. The final written report can be found at the following link: [https://rpubs.com/caleb94/706962](https://rpubs.com/caleb94/706962)
