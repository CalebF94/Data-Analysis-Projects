# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains examples projects that I have completed. Each project contains the code used to complete the project as well as other supporting files such as datasets or variables definitions. Brief descriptions of each project are provided below.


## COVID-19 Project

This was class project I completed in my survival analysis course. In the project, I compare the effect that COVID-19 had three countries in the early stage of the pandemic. I perform an exploratory data analysis, and then perform some statistical analyses using techniques such as Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. The analysis is performed using R, Rmarkdown, and Latex. R packages used include ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, muhaz, survival, and survminer.



## MLB Salaries Project

This was independent project I completed in my free time. In the project, I scraped data from the internet and created a Shiny web app that can be used to compare salaries of MLB teams and players between the years of 1985 and 2016. The interactive app has numerous graphics and is user friendly. This project was completed in R and used packages such as Shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, and htmlab. The app can be accessed at the following link: [https://caleb94.shinyapps.io/MLBSalaries/](https://caleb94.shinyapps.io/MLBSalaries/)
