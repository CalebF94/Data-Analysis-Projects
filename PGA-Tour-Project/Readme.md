### Report Description
This was an independent project where I attempted to predict the stroke average and winners on the PGA Tour for the 2019 season. I used regression and classification methods such as KNN, SVM, random forest, and logistic regression. This project was completed in Rmarkdown in Rstudio and used packages such as caret, tree, random forest and the tidyverse packages.
