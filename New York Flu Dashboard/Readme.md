This is a dashboard I created in Excel that analyzes flu activity in the state of New York. I didn't have any research questions in particular. This project was intended to practice my Excel skills. This project demonstrates my ability to use Excel functions, pivot tables, data models, and visualization tools. The final dashboard consists of two tabs and is found in the .xlsx file. The raw data can be found in the files titled "FluCases" and "Counties".
