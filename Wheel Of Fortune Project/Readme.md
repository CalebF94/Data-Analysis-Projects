### Description
This is an independent project where I analyzed data from the Bonus Round of the TV game show Wheel Of Fortune. I created a web scraper to gather data that allowed me to determine which letters appear most often, which letters contestants choose most often, and which categories are the hardest. This project was completed using R and Rmarkdown in Rstudio and used packages such as rvest, dplyr, lubridate, and kable. The final written report can be found at the following link: https://rpubs.com/caleb94/706962
