This is a class project I completed. It demonstrates my use of basic SAS, PROC SQL, and DATA step analysis. The assignment was to pick 10 varaibles that I thought were important and to summarize them.

The PDF document contains my final written report, and the .sas file contains the code I used to produce the output contained in the final report.
